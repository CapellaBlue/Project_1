This game is a two player game designed to take in a sequence of four colors as a code from the first player, the Code Maker.
The second player, the Code Breaker is then given one opportunity to guess the code maker's sequence. If the guess is correct, 
the code breaker wins. If the guess is incorrect, the code maker gives the code breaker feedback about the attempt. If the guess
contains any colors in the correct sequence, the code maker gives one black peg. If the code breaker guessed any colors that
were correct but that were not in the correct sequence, the code maker places one white peg. From these clues about the guess 
made, the code breaker then attempts to guess again. There are 10 rounds to guess the sequence. If the code is not broken 
within those ten attempts, the code maker wins.

This game is my first project using JavaScript/Jquery, HTML/CSS
